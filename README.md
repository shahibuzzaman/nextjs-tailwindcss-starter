# Nextjs + Tailwind Css + ESLint + husky Starter Template

This is a Nextjs & TailwindCSS template with all the dependencies already set up and ready to go for development.

**Modules and libraries pre-installed in this template**:
- nextjs (Reactjs framework)
- react (Js library. Comes with NextJs)
- tailwindcss (A utility-first CSS framework.)
- postcss (Transform CSS with the power of JavaScript.)
- autoprefixer (PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.)
- prettier (An opinionated code formatter.)
- ESLint (ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.)
- eslint-config-google (ESLint [shareable config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs.html) for the [Google JavaScript style guide (ES2015+ version)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html))
- eslint-config-prettier (Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.)
- eslint-plugin-react (React specific linting rules for eslint.)
- husky (husky is a tool that allows us to run script before commit / before push into git, using husky and lint-staged we can create a script to check / force fix any code using ESLint.)

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies & run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# and
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
